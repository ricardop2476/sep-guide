                    <p>Welcome to the SEP Guide! Here you will find information for parents, teachers, and students. The HSTAT SEP Curriculum is also available for grades 9-12. The Software Engineering Program (SEP) is a software engineering education program.
                        Students do not need prior knowledge of programing to join. This four year program will prepare students for future careers, spark new ideas & creativity, and will help them build essential skills that they can apply in and out
                        of the classroom.</p>

                    <p>Your child wants to join SEP or is already enrolled in it. How can I help my child succeed in this program? You should have a working computer at home with internet access because, students will have homework or will work on projects
                        at home. If this is not available do not worry! Students can visit tutoring Tuesdays and Thursdays, and can use computers at the school during and after school hours. Visit our about page to learn more details about the program.</p>

                    <h1>Teachers</h1>
                    <p>Welcome! You are planning to be or are a SEP teacher. Here you will learn about the best ways to give your students the best experience they can have in this program. If you are planning to be a SEP teacher you should do it because
                        you can expand your own knowledge of programing. You can also inspire and educate the next generation of teachers, web designers, coders, etc. If you are a SEP teacher you should expose students to basic programs and concepts in
                        the beginning of the class. Encourage pair or group collaboration, however individual assignments should be done to build one's own understanding of the topic.</p>

                    <p>As a student, you should consider joining the SEP even if you do not plan on pursuing a career in this field. Students can join regardless of past experience with programing. The skills that you learn in this class will and can be
                        applied in and out of the classroom. In this program you will be able to work with your classmates to build games, websites, interactive art, and more. Trips for this class are fairly common. Students in the past years have visited
                        the Squarespace HQ, Microsoft, Google, and more! Make coding your way of expressing what you like and use it to change the world around you. As coders we find it best that we learn from each other. Therefore aside from having a
                        lot of collaboration in the classroom we often times share our projects with the class. Each student will make their own portfolio hosted on Google sites. </p>

                    <h3>Scratch</h3>
                    <p>Scratch is a visual programming language in which one could make games, interactive animations, and other creations. This is a beneficial and great first step to the SEP because, it introduces students to an idea of what coding is.
                        Scratch is a door to more complex lessons/topics that students will learn further on in the curriculum. Users will find that it is very easy to share their work with others in the classroom as well.</p>

                    <h3>Robotics</h3>
                    <p>Robotics consists of mechanical engineering, electrical engineering, computer science, and many more. Students will interact with computer systems for their control, by using the EV3 programming software. It allows for one to write
                        very specific programs that take advantage of all the different aspects of your robot. Like Scratch, the EV3 software uses a block-based programming language. We will use Lego Mindstorms for our robots to allow for sensory feedback,
                        and information processing.</p>

                    <h3>Python</h3>
                    <p>Python is a major programming language used for general purposes because it is very flexible. For example, it can be used for web development to software development and scientific applications. One aspect that makes Python unique
                        is its emphasis on how code is visually represented. It is easy to read because its syntax allows programmers to express their code in fewer lines than other programing languages.</p>

                    <h3>P5JS</h3>
                    <p>P5.js is a Javascript library that is a native JavaScript alternative to Processing.js. This makes coding for this program more accessible to different groups of people such as artists, designers, educators, and more. People are able
                        to make drawings, animations, and interactive art.</p>

                    <h3>Circuits</h3>
                    <p>To learn about Circuits, students will use the Makey Makey and the Arduino Uno. The Makey Makey is is an electronic invention tool that allows users to connect everyday objects to computer programs. It takes keyboard and mouse click
                        inputs in order to function. The Arduino Uno allows users to write their code and wire their own circuits. It is a library written on top of Java.</p>

                    <h3>Data</h3>
                    <p>In this topic, students will analyze and develop conclusions upon studying sets of data. Students will learn how to use spreadsheets to help them make these conclusions, and will create an Infographic to share their findings.</p>

                    <h3>Github</h3>
                    <p>Github is a Git repository hosting service. Git helps the coder have basic access to the past revisions of their directory. Github is a platform that saves your code online (in the cloud). In order to use this, you need to have Git.
                        Github also provides easy collaboration on projects. In order to use Github you need to have Git. It also provides access control and several collaboration features such as bug tracking, feature requests, and task management.</p>

                    <h3>Web Design</h3>
                    <p>Web Design aims to educate students about website development. This covers HTML & CSS, Javascript, jQuery, and Bootstrap. Students will progressively build websites on their own and with a partner to learn all about front end development.</p>

                    <h3>3D Modeling</h3>
                    <p>In this topic, students will be able to create anything that they want with a program, and then they will be able to print it out. They will “Create 3D renderings of objects” - hstat.org/sep11. This course is only about 2-3 weeks,
                        (end of the year project) however it is a clear outlet to inspiring a possible future job.</p>

                    <h3>Ruby</h3>
                    <p>Ruby is a programing language that “serves [as] the back end of many web applications” - hstat.org/sep12. This is a very popular language and is in high demand in the market place. It is clear/readable however it is very powerful because
                        programmers can change and redefine parts of Ruby.</p>

                    <h3>Sinatra</h3>
                    <p>Sinatra is a program that is written in Ruby. Sinatra is a small and is used to write web page applications. This program is ideal for students to get started with web application development. This flexible language will help students
                        prepare for more complex languages in the future, such as “Ruby on Rails”. According to hstat.org/sep12, students will “apply the Model-View-Controller framework and interact with APIs.”</p>

                    <h3>Independent Study</h3>
                    <p>In this topic, students will aim towards learning a new topic on their own, and then will present their findings to the class. Students will, “research, build with, and present on the topic of their choosing” - hstat.org/sep12.</p>
