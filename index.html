                    <p>Welcome to the SEP Guide! Here you will find information for parents, teachers, and students. The HSTAT SEP Curriculum is also available for grades 9-12. The Software Engineering Program (SEP) is a software engineering education program.
                        Students do not need prior knowledge of programing to join. This four year program will prepare students for future careers, spark new ideas & creativity, and will help them build essential skills that they can apply in and out
                        of the classroom.</p>

                    <p>Your child wants to join SEP or is already enrolled in it. How can I help my child succeed in this program? You should have a working computer at home with internet access because, students will have homework or will work on projects
                        at home. If this is not available do not worry! Students can visit tutoring Tuesdays and Thursdays, and can use computers at the school during and after school hours. Visit our about page to learn more details about the program.</p>

                    <p>Welcome! You are planning to be or are a SEP teacher. Here you will learn about the best ways to give your students the best experience they can have in this program. If you are planning to be a SEP teacher you should do it because you can expand your own knowledge of programing. You can also inspire and educate the next generation of teachers, web designers, coders, etc. If you are a SEP teacher you should expose students to basic programs and concepts in the beginning of the class. Encourage pair or group collaboration, however individual assignments should be done to build one's own understanding of the topic.</p>

                    <p>As a student, you should consider joining the SEP even if you do not plan on pursuing a career in this field. Students can join regardless of past experience with programing. The skills that you learn in this class will and can be applied in and out of the classroom. In this program you will be able to work with your classmates to build games, websites, interactive art, and more. Trips for this class are fairly common. Students in the past years have visited the Squarespace HQ, Microsoft, Google, and more!  Make coding your way of expressing what you like and use it to change the world around you. As coders we find it best that we learn from each other. Therefore aside from having a lot of collaboration in the classroom we often times share our projects with the class. Each student will make their own portfolio hosted on Google sites. </p>
